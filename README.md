# Credit-Card-Validator-C-

Uses the Luhn algorithm to validate it.

If the credit card number is valid, it outputs a success message; otherwise, it outputs an error message.

i want to expand it , make it check for other common mistakes in credit card numbers. 


Luhn algorithm:

Starting from the rightmost digit, double every second digit.
If the result of doubling is greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.
Sum all the digits of the number.
If the total is divisible by 10, the number is considered valid.
