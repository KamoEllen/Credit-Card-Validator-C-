# Credit-Card-Validator-C-

This code reads in a credit card number from the user and uses the Luhn algorithm to validate it. If the credit card number is valid, it outputs a success message; otherwise, it outputs an error message.

You can modify and expand upon this code to add more functionality to your credit card validator, such as the ability to identify the type of credit card based on its number or to check for other common mistakes in credit card numbers.
